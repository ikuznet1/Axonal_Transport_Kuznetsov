Finding values of parameters in Table S3 that give the best fit with experimental results for MAP1B protein transport. 
The global minimum was found by using routine MULTISTART with a local solver FMINCON, which can be found in Matlabâ€™s 
Optimization Toolbox. 5000 randomly selected starting points in the parameter space were used to start the optimization 
procedure.
